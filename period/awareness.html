    <center><h2> Awareness</h2><br>
    <p> Feminine hygiene products are a necessity for half the world's population, <br>yet not much are aware of the fact that many are unable to afford these essentials. <br>It is a global problem. </p>
    <p> Across the world, an estimated 100 million young people lack access to adequate menstrual products.<br>
        This is called period poverty. <br>
        Without access to these products, many students miss school or drop out entirely during their period. <br>
        In the United States, 26.4 million people can’t afford menstrual products. <br>
        In Sub-Saharan Africa, one in 10 students miss school during their period. <br>
        In India, one in four students don’t come to school when they’re menstruating. <br>
        Having a period shouldn’t have to cost a student their education. </p>

    <p> Menstrual equity is the equal access to hygiene products.<br>
      All should have access to these products and shouldn't be taxed because they are necessities. </p>
