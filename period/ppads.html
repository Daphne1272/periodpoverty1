     <h2> Period Pads </h2>
     <h3> What are they? </h3>
     <p> They are rectangles of absorbent material that attaches to the inside of a pair of underwear.<br>Some have extra material called "wings" that help keep the pad in place and prevent leakage. </p>
     <p> They come in different sizes and thicknesses for heavier or lighter menstrual periods and day or nighttime. </p>
     <p>  It's a sanitary napkin, sanitary towel, sanitary pad, menstrual pad, or pad is an absorbent item worn in the underwear by women and girls who are menstruating, bleeding after giving birth, recovering from gynecologic surgery, experiencing a miscarriage or abortion, or in any other situation where it is necessary to absorb a flow of blood from the vagina. <br>A menstrual pad is a type of feminine hygiene product that is worn externally, unlike tampons and menstrual cups which are worn inside the vagina. <br>The frequency a woman will need to change her pad will vary depending on whether her menstrual flow is heavy or light. </p>
     <h3> Are there any risks? </h3>
     <p> There are still risks of leaking if you don't change regularly and depending on how heavy the menstrual period. </p>
     <p> Regular changing can also prevent the buildup of bacteria and eliminate odor. </p>
